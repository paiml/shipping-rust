#!/usr/bin/env bash
# No self-hosted job may use `Swatinem/rust-cache` (or a wrapper of it) on the
# fleet's SHARED $CARGO_HOME.
#
# WHY THE RULE CHANGED (paiml/infra#775, 2026-09-19)
#
# This lint used to say: every `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` use must set
# `cache-bin: "false"`. That was the mitigation from paiml/infra#208, and it was
# wrong — not incomplete, wrong, in a way that made this file bless the hazard
# it was written to stop.
#
# `cache-bin: false` skips `cleanBin` and nothing else. rust-cache's save step
# also runs `cleanRegistry`, unconditionally, which deletes
# ${CARGO_HOME}/registry/src — the extracted crate sources every OTHER job on
# the box is compiling from at that moment. All 16 intel-clean-room-* runners
# share HOME=/home/noah, so that directory is shared by every concurrent job.
#
# Measured on intel 2026-09-19: eight rust-cache save steps in 100 minutes, the
# birth time of every crate directory under the shared registry pinned to the
# second one of them finished, and an infra `cargo kani` build killed mid-crate
# with `could not parse/generate dep info at .../serde_core-<hash>.d: No such
# file or directory`. The step that killed it carried `cache-bin: "false"`. That
# error message is what aprender#2822 attributes to the ci-reaper, which had
# last run 27 minutes earlier.
#
# WHAT EXONERATES A USE, AND WHAT DOES NOT
#
# Only a job-private CARGO_HOME. It is the only thing that moves the SOURCES out
# of the shared directory. `--target-dir`, `cargo install --root` and a fresh
# $HOME do NOT: cargo reads crate sources from $CARGO_HOME whatever the target
# dir is, so a job that writes nothing shared is still compiling out of a
# directory another job's save step can delete underneath it. Measured example:
# paiml-implement's t12 install leg runs in a fresh $HOME and deliberately hands
# its legs the real shared CARGO_HOME, so it is fully exposed.
#
# On a persistent runner ~/.cargo persists between jobs by itself, so the
# RESTORE is a no-op and the SAVE is the entire effect. The remedy is to delete
# the step.
#
# WHY THIS REPO IN PARTICULAR
#
# rmedia hit the bin half FOUR TIMES. #283 fixed one of two call sites in one
# file and #289 then moved the other onto the fleet, deleting cargo mid-run.
# This lint was written then, and it encoded the mitigation rather than the
# hazard — so for a month it certified five steps that were deleting the shared
# registry, and one of them killed an infra build on 2026-09-19.
#
# WHY THE DENOMINATOR IS PRINTED AND ZERO USES IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY OK
#
# The previous version's pass line was "(N rust-cache use(s) across M workflows,
# all guarded)". With the action deleted everywhere, N is 0 and the old check
# passes having verified nothing — the vacuity this fleet is bitten by roughly
# once a month. So this version reports what it SCANNED (workflows, and
# self-hosted jobs among them) and refuses to pass on a zero denominator of
# either. `--selftest` proves it can still reject.
set -uo pipefail

# The actions that cache $CARGO_HOME. `setup-rust-toolchain` wraps rust-cache
# and its `cache:` input defaults to true, so an unconfigured use prunes and
# deletes exactly as a bare one does — and `cache-bin: false` does not turn it
# off either.

# HERE-STRINGS, NOT `printf ... | grep -q`, AND THIS IS LOAD-BEARING.
#
# Under `set -o pipefail`, `grep -q` exits at the first match and SIGPIPEs the
# writer, so the PIPELINE's status can be 141 even though the test matched —
# which makes a membership test answer the opposite of the truth, silently.
# rmedia bans the shape repo-wide (falsify-pipefail-contains.sh) and its CI
# caught the sibling copy of this lint on its first run. A lint that reports a wrong answer
# about a fleet-destroying step is worse than no lint, so the shape is gone
# rather than worked around.

# Does this workflow have at least one job that can land on the fleet?
# A `runs-on:` naming self-hosted, clean-room, or anything that is not an
